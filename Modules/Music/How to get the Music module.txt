Open the jar file with java NOT WINRAR OR ANY OTHER ARCHIVE APP

It will so you don't have a config

Put in a bot token from https://discordapp.com/developers then 
my apps create one and then 
create a user

By default the prefix is just mentioning the bot 
example: @RainMaster-Music music-search Nocopyrightsounds

To change the prefix go into the config.txt that was made by the jar
then add a line that is prefix=YOURPREFIX

Example:
token=YOURTOKEN
ownerid=YOURID
prefix=/music-

If you want to get your id then in discord go to User Settings then
appearance then turn on developer mode go right click on your user
then press "Copy ID"
